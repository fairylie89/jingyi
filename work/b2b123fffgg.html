      <p>The B2B portal is an online payments platform, aiming to help businesses pay and get paid easier, make the payment process more transparent and secure.</p>
      
      <h2 id="history">The History: Started From The Finovate</h2>
      <p>In Feb 2017 and April 2017, nanopay showcased the B2B platform with integrations with invoicing software Freshbooks and Xero.</p>
      <figure>
        <div class="videoWrapper">

      <p>Because of the tight deadline for the Finovate demo, we took a dirty approach: A brainstorming workshop with the product and development team for a minimum viable product. </p>
      <figure class="gap">

      <h2 id="role">My Role</h2>
      <p>After the demo, we decided to rethink the B2B portal as we have more time. I worked closely with the customer success manager in the research phase, and with the product & development team in the ideation and testing phase. I was responsible for the interaction & visual design of the B2B portal, as well as the design & front-end development of the B2B landing page. </p>
      
      <h2 id="research">The Research Phase</h2>
      <p>The plan looks like: </p>

      <p>The design needs to reflect both user needs and the business goals. Based on the user research, I summarized the project goals as below.</p>
      <ul class="gap goal">
        <li>Deliver a visually consistent application aligned with the nanopay new branding</li>
        <li>Reduce users' effort and cost to process B2B payments</li>
        <li>Empower users with more transparent and friendly payment process</li>
        <li>Help users to keep track of deadlines</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="solution">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
      <p>Based on research, we came up with 3 solutions to help users solve the pain points with multiple design iterations and validations.</p>
      <h3>Challenge #1: How to make the process easier and more efficient?</h3>
      <p>B2B payment lives in a complex context, <span><a href="https://medium.com/wharton-fintech/why-checks-still-exist-and-the-state-of-b2b-payments-b41f3cddea9c" target="_blank"> the volume, people involved and the payment lifecycle made it so different from the P2P and B2C payments</a></span>.</p>

      <h4 class="gap">Streamline the Process by Combining Invoicing & Payment Capability</h4>
      <figure class="gap">

        <figcaption>2-6 / The new flow of paying and getting paid for businesses </figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h4>#1 Providing Basic Invoicing Functionality</h4>
      <p>In order to make the payment process more smooth, we incorporated the basic invoicing capability into the system. Users can create a simple invoice, send or receive one from partners in the nanopay ecosystem.<br>
      We explored two directions of creating an invoice:</p>
      <ol class="goal gap">
        <li>An-invoice-like interface with line items for input</li>
        <li>Regular input fields with attachment</li>
      </ol> 
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/2-7.jpg" srcset="../img/2-7@2x.jpg 2x, ../img/2-7@3x.jpg 3x" alt="Two directions on invoicing screen">
        <figcaption>2-7 / Early sketches on two directions of invoicing screens</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We decided to go with NO.2 as our main focus is on the payment, so the invoicing ability should be very basic to minimize cost. Also, the attachment offered a way to share all the other details.<br><br>
      The following are some important questions we asked ourselves.</p>
      <ul class="goal gap">
        <li>Should the invoice be auto-generated or manually input? - different use cases</li>
        <li>How to help users find the customer quickly and accurately? Should it be a drop down, a dynamic filter, or? What happened if we have customers with the same name? What if they are not onboard with B2B portal yet?</li>
        <li>What if the users have some comments on the invoice?</li>
        <li>Draft and preview? - leave without fear and send with confirmation</li>
        <li>How to help users communicate better in the B2B platform?</li>
        <li>What about recurring invoices?</li>
      </ul> 
      <figure class="big">

      </figure>
      
      <h4>#2 Syncing from Accounting Software</h4>
      <p>What we’ve offered is a limited invoicing capability, for users relying on accounting software, we designed the sync between the B2B portal and the software.<br>
      With the sync:</p>
      <ol class="gap">
        <li>Received invoices will be synced to nanopay</li>
        <li>Existing users will be synced to nanopay (under development)</li>
      </ol>

      <figure>
        <table>
          <tr>

            <td>Low</td>
            <td>High (many actions)</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <figcaption>Table / The comparison between Modal and New Page for actions like pay now, void, assign.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After careful considerations and talking with developers, we decided to go with modals if the steps are less than three. As most actions are one step: confirm/add optional comments - Click action button, creating a new page will be too much cost. For steps more than two, wizard view.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-8-5.png" srcset="../img/2-8-5@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-8-5@3x.png 3x" alt="Modal and wizard view">
        <figcaption>2-8-5 / Modal is for actions like pay now, approve, decline, and wizard view is for more complicated actions like connecting a bank account, onboarding customers and provisioning a device.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This was a critical challenge for me, and I have learned that:</p> 
      <ol class="goal gap">
        <li>Be brave to make a decision and take the risk</li>
        <li>DO carefully analyze and ask for feedback as it affects long-term implementation</li>
        <li>Be consistent but also open to changes if it doesn't work well</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="gap">Challenge #2: How to make the process more transparent?</h3>
      <blockquote class="gap">
        "You know, <span>once the payment starts to process, we have no control.</span> Who knows what happened in that 5 business days..."

        "Well, I only care <span>when we will get paid</span>."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="gap">
        "If we could, just <span>share everything with the partner and the members</span>"
      </blockquote>
      
      <h4 class="gap">What does it mean to be transparent?</h4>
      <ul class="goal gap">
        <li><b>Users always know the latest status of an invoice</b></li>
        <li>What happens after the users click “pay now”?<br> The transaction should clearly <b>state the different status it is going through, and let users know when something is wrong</b></li>
        <li><b>The vendor and customer (payee and payer) share information equally</b>.<br>Such as any changes related to altering the invoice, invoice status, public comments</li>
        <li><b>Users within the same party share information efficiently</b> <br>Such as people involved will be notified of the changes of an invoice/status/internal comments</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4 class="gap">Solution: A History Audit</h4>
      <p>A history section for both vendor and customer to view history, track status changes and share comments.</p>

        <figcaption>2-9-1 /  Explorations on where the history should locate</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We decided to go with B & C as the history can go pretty long with many edits and comments, and also taking the fact that the invoice details always take up a fixed amount of space and the latest status is the most important.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>In critiquing those iterations, we thought about two questions:</p>
      <ol class="goal gap">
        <li><b>What order should the timeline be?</b><br>Users always want to see the latest status, they only go back to previous one if there is a mistake or they are looking for something, so we made the latest status appear at the top.</li>
        <li><b>What if the history goes too long?</b><br>Users only care about if they are getting paid and their payments go through so we deleted summary</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Challenge #3: How to better help users keep track of deadlines?</h3>
      <p>The most important task for an accountant or the small business owner is, to never miss a deadline for payment, but try to make the funds remain in the company's account as long as possible.  Remembering the key dates is a challenge and people keep sticky notes everywhere to remind themselves. Also, when paying an invoice, the time it costs to arrive has to be taken into consideration.</p>
      <ul class="goal gap">
        <li>Users need to know: by when they should pay, and they will get pay</li>
        <li>What they need to review and take action</li>
        <li>The money coming in and out to get an idea of liquidity</li>
        <li>How they are doing and how their team is doing</li>
      </ul>
      <figure class="gap">

      <h2 id="impact">The UX Impact</h2>
      <p>I led the research and design process in the B2B project. It's great to see that my efforts have had an impact on how the teams work together, and greatly grown up the UX influence in a fintech startup.<br><br>
      As the design team of one, I work hard to connect myself and proactively communicate with the rest of the team. Besides presenting design deliverables in our weekly Learn &amp; Share, I also set up design sessions to educate teammates about design-thinking and user-centered design, and involve developers in brainstorming and hands-on drawing workshops.I have a post about <span><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/in-the-pingpong-room-how-i-moderated-a-design-exercise-as-the-sole-designer-19adc397ffb6" target="_blank">my experience in a workshop I have done for this project.</a></span> </p>

        <figcaption>2-10-3 / Above is a shot of scene after we finished the design workshop</figcaption>

      <p>Gladly, the team started to provide feedback instead of just following the requirements. People started to think, reflect, and look at things in the perspective of users. These are all valuable input to help me get rid of my biases and ego, design in a more inclusive perspective, and make wiser design decisions.</p>

        <figcaption>2-11 / In the presentation of the design session I held with the team, I ended the presentation with these a few slides. I'm proud of myself as I didn't compromise and let it go, instead, I embraced the difference and brought up the UX impact.</figcaption>

      <h2 id="landing">Landing Page</h2>
      <p>I was responsible for designing and developing the landing page for the B2B portal. </p>
      <h3>The Design</h3>
      <p>Similar to designing the landing page of the retail portal, <span><a href="retail.html">we took the same approach</a></span> and highlighted the 3 solutions we made to transform B2B payments.</p>
      <figure>
        <img class="big" src="../img/2-12.png" srcset="../img/2-12@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-12@3x.png 3x" alt="the comparison of two versions of responsive layouts of B2B landing page">
        <figcaption>2-12 / The right is the final version of the landing page. Compared to the initial draft, we put the feature screenshots in one place and used some illustrations to delight the users.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I created illustrations using the B2B mockup elements and animate them to deliver a delightful experience.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img class="group"src="../img/2-13.gif" alt="animation of Instant feature">
        <img class="group"src="../img/2-14.gif" alt="animation of Transparent feature">
        <img class="group"src="../img/2-15.gif" alt="animation of Secure feature">
        <figcaption>2-13,14,15 / These 3 animations reflect the 3 key features of the portal. I used animations instead of showing the actual screenshots to reduce overloading information and convey a clearer and delightful message.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>The Development</h3>
      <p>This is my first front-end development project. As a beginner, I spent lots of time learning HTML5 and CSS to make the site responsive; I also used JavaScript to program the image picker, allowing users to view different images using tabs in web and dropdown in mobile. <br><br>
      By doing actual front-end development myself, I got a deeper empathy with developers. I got to know some buzzwords like box-model and specificity, understand how positioning works in CSS, etc. In this way, I was able to design with both user needs and a developer mind.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-15.1.gif" alt="animation of Instant feature">
        <figcaption>2-15.1 / In the above example, I was only responsible for the UI development and limited functionality such as file picker and the small pop up window. All other functions such as browser compatibility and end-points to the portal were handled by other developers.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h2 id="challenge">Two More Challenges</h2>
      <p>Besides the design problem, there were two other major challenges in the design journey: <b>the nanopay rebranding and the change of technology strategy - migrate all the services to the same server</b>.<br><br>
      The fresh and new nanopay branding required me to reinvent the visual experience of B2B platform.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/2-16.png" srcset="../img/2-16@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-16@3x.png 3x" alt="the rebranding of nanopay">
        <figcaption>2-16 / Along with the rebrand, we have a redefined color palette so I rip out the old style and reinvented the look and feel of the B2B portal</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In the middle of the project, the development team decided to hook all the nanopay services to one platform with access control by user group, instead of building different portals, to achieve higher performance. <br><br>
      The change of the technology direction challenged me on the <b>scalability and compatibility</b> of my design, as all the services will share the same design structure, similar user flow and experience, with the same look and feel. However, this is also an excellent opportunity, which led to my latest project - <span><a href="system.html"> nanopay Design System: Accelerating Design and Development</a></span>.</p>
      
      <h2 id="launch">Launch and Learn</h2>
      <p>In Dec 2017, <span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2017/nanopay-b2b-payments-platform/" target="_blank">nanopay launched B2B portal in a private beta-testing with invited partners</a></span>. One really important lesson we learned is the <b>security and compliance</b> in the payment industry.<br><br>
      As designers, we've always been taught to make the design as simple, easy to use as possible. However, that is not always the case. I have wondered many times why we have to ask users for "extra information" in the onboarding process, but that is to protect everyone's money and security from fraud.<br><br>
      Payment is a serious thing. In our case, it might be just a few hundred dollars, but for business, it can be a multi-billion transaction. We should always really <b>think about the context of the industry</b>, instead of over-simplifying the process. <b>Security and privacy should never be sacrificed for the ease of use.</b> </p>
