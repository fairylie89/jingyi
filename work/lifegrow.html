      <p>LifeGrow, a productive app, is one of my passion projects aiming to motivate people to increase productivity, be more focused and finish challenges by growing a digital plant in their mobile phone.</p>
      <div class="cta"><a class="btn" href="http://http://froont.com/fairy/lifegrow-grow-your-life-with-plants" target="_blank">LifeGrow Landing Page</a></div>
      
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>LifeGrow was inspired by the conversations and discussions regarding the emotional needs of people and <span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days#t-9522" target="_blank">the Ted Talk from Matt Cutts: Try something new for 30 days.</a></span><br><br>
      The society is becoming more and more competitive. Companies are eager to develop the latest technologies, designers are competing to give birth to the most innovative ideas and people tend to begin a more and more fast-paced life. As a designer, I deeply feel the pain of <b>anxiety, not being able to commit task effectively</b> and <b>procrastination</b>.From there, an idea about motivating people with a healing experience has come to my mind. </p>
      
      <h2>People's Voice and Goals</h2>
      <p>I soon turned to people asking for their experience about anxiety and procrastination, found that it is a common pain. <b>The feeling of not being motivated, the lack of continuous achievement feedback</b> and the <b>social stress</b> are the key reasons for not being able to fulfill our goals.<br><br>
      We want a way to <b>motivate ourselves, mildly, naturally and positively</b>. And that is why I came up with the idea of using plants as a motivation, to encourage people in a peaceful, yet powerful way. Inspired by <span><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a></span>, I decided to apply the gamification principles to achieve more interactivity and empower users.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/other/5-2.jpg" srcset="../img/other/5-2@2x.jpg 2x,  ../img/other/5-2@3x.jpg 3x"alt="mind mapping on how to achieve the product goal">
        <figcaption>5-2 /I did a small mind mapping on the user goal and how to achieve the goals.</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      
       <h2>Design Process</h2>
       <p>Based on initial research findings, I decided the MVP will be <b>motivating people with the growth of the plants.</b></p>
       <h3 class="gap">1. User Flow</h3> 
       <figure class="gap">
         <img src="../img/other/5-3.jpg" srcset="../img/other/5-3@2x.jpg 2x,  ../img/other/5-3@3x.jpg 3x"alt="tasks and user flow">
        <figcaption>5-3 / As the main task is to finish a challenge , I identified the initial related tasks and user flow.</figcaption>
       </figure>
       <h3 class="gap">2. Information Architecture</h3> 
       <figure class="gap">
         <img src="../img/other/5-4.jpg" srcset="../img/other/5-4@2x.jpg 2x,  ../img/other/5-4@3x.jpg 3x"alt="IA of the app">
        <figcaption>5-4 / According to user flow, there are 4 parts of the app: home, challenge, achievement, and setting</figcaption>
       </figure>
       <h3 class="gap">3. Sketching</h3> 
       <figure class="gap">
         <img src="../img/other/5-5.jpg" srcset="../img/other/5-5@2x.jpg 2x,  ../img/other/5-5@3x.jpg 3x"alt="Initial sketches">
        <figcaption>5-5 / I sketched out the initial screens and flows</figcaption>
       </figure>
       <h3 class="gap">4. Low-fi Prototype and Testing</h3> 
       <figure>
        <div class="videoWrapper">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OanxdLCm5SI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
        <figcaption>Video /  </figcaption>
       </figure>
       <p>I used mockup plus to make the first version of low-fi prototype and tested with a few participants, with the following problems identified.</p>
       <ol class="goal gap">
         <li> Not natural transition from the first challenge page back to home (revised) </li>
         <li> Structural problem of the initial homepage(revised) </li>
         <li>Sub-menus too complicated in the Collection page. Users need to go up to three submenus to access the history</li>
       </ol>
       
       <h2 class="gap">Deliverables</h2>
       <h3>1. High-fi Interactive Prototype</h3>

       <h3>2. Mature User Flow</h3>
       <p>I showcase the screens a mature user can see, which are not shown in the prototype above. </p>
       <figure class="gap">
         <img src="../img/other/5-6-1.png" srcset="../img/other/5-6-1@2x.png 2x,  ../img/other/5-6-1@3x.png 3x"alt="UI design for returning user flow">
         <figcaption>5-6-1 /  For a mature returning user, she might have multiple challenges going on, so the screens show the achievements she achieved and the seeds she has finished challenges with.</figcaption>
       </figure>
       <h3>3. UI KIT</h3>
       <p>To make the experience more delighted, I've put some efforts on crafting the seeds, growing plants and badges.</p>
       <figure class="gap">
         <img src="../img/other/5-6-2.jpg" srcset="../img/other/5-6-2@2x.jpg 2x,  ../img/other/5-6-2@3x.jpg 3x"alt="Flower Seed Kit">
         <figcaption>5-6-2 / Flower Seed Kit: The first plant set of 9 flower seeds. They were made combining the original appearance and the typical features of the plant. </figcaption>

         <figcaption>5-6-3 / Achievement Badge Kit: Implementing the gamification principle, 9 badges about the plants were created. The user can get rewarded once they have successfully finished a 30-day challenge.</figcaption>

         <figcaption>5-6-4 / Growing Flower: The plant will grow every day if the user continues to check off the challenge on time, offering a dynamic growth for motivation.</figcaption>

         <figcaption>5-6-5 / I only created the growing process for one  plant - the bellflowers for demo purpose.</figcaption>
