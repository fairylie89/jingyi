      <p>The B2B portal is an online payments platform, aiming to help businesses pay and get paid easier, make the payment process completely transparent and more secure.</p>
      
      <h2 id="history">The History: Started From The Finovate</h2>
      <p>Back in 2016, after <span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadas-nanopay-acquires-mintchip-technology-from-royal-canadian-mint-1452613320" target="_blank">acquiring MintChip from the Royal Canadian Mint</a></span>,  nanopay launched the <span><a href="retail.html" target="_blank">retail portal</a></span> in 2017 ( the first project I worked on).  At the same time,  I was also working on <span><a href="https://nanopay.net/solutions/b2b-payments/" target="_blank">the B2B solution</a></span> - utilizing the MintChip technology to make B2B payment process faster, more transparent and secure.<br><br>
      Because of the tight deadline for the Finovate demo, we took a dirty approach: Based on what we had, we quickly did a brainstorming and drawing workshop with the product team and developers for a minimul viable product. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/2-2.jpg" srcset="../img/2-2@2x.jpg 2x, ../img/2-2@3x.jpg 3x" alt="Photos of brainstorming workshop">
        <figcaption>2-2 / In the workshop, we decided quickly on priorities based on the main focus: demonstrate the capability of supporting B2B payments integrating with invoicing software. Then started on brainstorming and drawing on the whiteboard.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In Feb 2017 and April 2017, nanopay showcased the B2B platform with integrations with invoicing softwares Freshbooks and Xero.</p>

      </figure>
      
      <h2 id="research">The Research Phase</h2>
      <p>After the demo, we decided to redesign the B2B portal. I worked closely with the customer success representative and the product manager in the research phase. The plan looks like: </p>
      <figure>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Plan</th>
            <th>Objective</th>
            <th>Deliverables</th>
          </tr>

            <td>Understand customer's pain points and needs, discover the opportunity</td>
            <td>Notes, Persona, Design brainstorming</td>

            <td>Know how the competitors are doing and reflect on our product</td>
            <td>Competitive analysis report, Feature matrix map</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Interviews with stakeholders</td>
            <td>Understand the business requirements and expectation, decide the final requirements meeting both user and business goals </td>
            <td>Business requirement documents, Value proposition list, UI requirements </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <figcaption>Table / The initial research also includes the market fit research, which is the sales team's effort and not brought up here. The research phase one took around 4 weeks.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Based on the interviews with potential users, we created two personas.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-3.png" srcset="../img/2-3@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-3@3x.png 3x" alt="persona A - accountant">
        <img src="../img/2-4.png" srcset="../img/2-4@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-@3x.png 3x" alt="persona B - small business owner">
        <figcaption>2-3,2-4 / We created two personas based on initial interviews.They are the representatives of our target users: accountants/bookkeepers and small business owners.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h2 id="goals">Project Goals</h2>
      <p>The design needs to reflect both user needs and the business goals.Based on the user research, I summarized the project goals as below.</p>
      <ul class="gap goal">
        <li>Deliver a visually consistent application aligned with the nanopay new branding</li>
        <li>Reduce users' effort and cost to process B2B payments</li>
        <li>Empower users with more transparent and friendly payment process</li>
        <li>Help users to keep track of deadlines</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="solution">Solutions</h2>
      <p>Based on research, we came up with 3 solutions to help users solve the pain points with multiple design iterations and validations.</p>
      <h3>1. One Click Instant Payments</h3>
      <p>B2B payment lives in a complex context, <span><a href="https://medium.com/wharton-fintech/why-checks-still-exist-and-the-state-of-b2b-payments-b41f3cddea9c" target="_blank"> the volume, people involved and the payment lifecycle made it so different from the P2P and B2C payments</a></span>. By integrating with existing accounting software and providing limited invoicing capabilities, we managed to allow users to save time and cost on processing B2B payments.<br><br>
      Users can easily view an invoice synced from accounting partners or sent from vendors directly within the B2B system, and pay it with one click in real-time (using digital cash technology).</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-5.png" srcset="../img/2-5@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-5@3x.png 3x" alt="screenshot of one click payment">
        <figcaption>2-5 / In the detail view of account payables, users can pay an invoice with one click if the method of payment has been set up in advance. </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>2. Completely Transparent Payment Flow</h3>
      <p>Another pain point in B2B payments is the invisibility of a payment process. According to the interviews we conducted, once a wire(cross-border money transfer) or a domestic payment has been set up, it is hard to know the status of the payment, and how long it will take to show up in the vendor's bank account.<br><br>
      We've designed a transparent history auditing section attached to each invoice in the system. Every status change, action, and comment related is recorded. So users will always know when they are getting paid and whether their payments went through.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-6.png" srcset="../img/2-6@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-6@3x.png 3x" alt="screenshot of history section">
        <figcaption>2-6 / All the changes are recorded and shown in a reversed chronological manner.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>3. A Dashboard To Remind The Coming Days</h3>
      <p>The most important task for an accountant or the small business owner is, to never miss a deadline for payment, but try to make the funds remain in the company's account as long as possible.  Remembering the key dates is a challenge and people keep sticky notes everywhere to remind themselves. Also, when paying an invoice, the time it costs to arrive has to be taken into consideration. <br><br>
      And this is why we designed a dashboard with all the status of the invoices visible. Users can easily know what they need to do for the coming week. They can also schedule a payment easily to keep them away from the penalty. </p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-7.png" srcset="../img/2-7@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-7@3x.png 3x" alt="screenshot of history section">
        <figcaption>2-7 / Above is the dashboard for a company with multi-layer approval before a payment is processed. The mentions section gives users a grasp on what they need to do and a single click can take them right to the spot. </figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h2 id="process">Design Process</h2>
      <p>In the research phrase beforehand, I worked closely with the product manager to identify problems and goals, create personas and map out experience journeys. When coming into the actual fun part, I involved more with the develpment team to ideate, optimize user flows, wireframe and validate design solutions.</p>
      <h3>Ideation &amp; Sketching </h3>
      <p>After we gathered user needs and requirements, I held a brainstorming session with a diverse group consisting of developers and sales rep. We had great discussions on how we can solve the problems, lots of ideas and suggestions, and some very aspiring sketches of our product. I have a post about <span><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/in-the-pingpong-room-how-i-moderated-a-design-exercise-as-the-sole-designer-19adc397ffb6" target="_blank">my experience on this workshop.</a></span> </p>

        <figcaption>2-8 / The after scene after a brainstorming plus drawing session I held at nanopay with developers and sales team.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Optimizing User Flow</h3>
      <p>Based on the ideas we generated, I decided to move forward and started experimenting with the different users flow to finish the tasks. For regular flows like registration, forgot password, etc., I used general design patterns that have been adopted to save time.We focused on the paying an invoice and creating a bill.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-9.jpg" srcset="../img/2-9@2x.jpg 2x, ../img/2-9@3x.jpg 3x" alt="user flow charts">
        <figcaption>2-9 / When I do design critiques, I print out copies and put it on the wall to present to every participant.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Validation &amp; Iteration</h3>
      <p>I used sketchings, low-fidelity mockups to validate my design before moving into the pixels. Due to limited resources and time, I tested with inner employees and did multiple rounds of discussion and critique with the PM and developers. Then I moved to the high-fi mockups and presented to the stakeholders before handing off to development.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-10.gif" alt="different versions of the dashboard">
        <figcaption>2-10 / The evlolution of the main dashboard</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h2 id="impact">The UX Impact</h2>
      <p>As the sole designer, I led the research and design process. It's great to see that my efforts have had an impact on how the teams work together, and greatly grown up the UX influence in a fintech startup.<br><br>
      As the design team of one, I work hard to connect myself and proactively communicate with the rest of the team. Besides presenting design deliverables in our weekly Learn &amp; Share, I also set up design sessions to educate teammates about design-thinking and user-centered design, and involve developers in brainstorming and hands-on drawing workshops.<br><br>
      Gladly, the team started to provide feedback instead of just following the requirements. People started to think, reflect, and look at things in the perspective of users. These are all valuable input to help me get rid of my biases and ego, design in a more inclusive perspective, and make wiser design decisions.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-11.gif" alt="from the design team of one to the design team of all">
        <figcaption>2-11 / In the presentation of the design session I held with the team, I ended the presentation with these a few slides. I'm proud of myself as I didn't compromise and let it go, instead, I embraced the difference and brought up the UX impact.</figcaption>
      </figure>
     
      <h2 id="landing">Landing Page</h2>
      <p>I was responsible for designing and developing the landing page for the B2B portal. </p>
      <h3>The Design</h3>
      <p>Similar to designing the landing page of the retail portal, <span><a href="retail.html">we took the same approach</a></span> and highlighted the 3 solutions we made to transform B2B payments.</p>
      <figure>
        <img class="big" src="../img/2-12.png" srcset="../img/2-12@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-12@3x.png 3x" alt="the comparison of two versions of responsive layouts of B2B landing page">
        <figcaption>2-12 / The right is the final version of the landing page. Compared to the initial draft, we put the feature screenshots in one place and used some illustrations to delight the users.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I created illustrations using the B2B mockup elements and animate them to deliver a delightful experience.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img class="group"src="../img/2-13.gif" alt="animation of Instant feature">
        <img class="group"src="../img/2-14.gif" alt="animation of Transparent feature">
        <img class="group"src="../img/2-15.gif" alt="animation of Secure feature">
        <figcaption>2-13,14,15 / These 3 animations reflect the 3 key features of the portal. I used animations instead of showing the actual screenshots to reduce overloading information and convey a clearer and delightful message.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>The Development</h3>
      <p>This is my first front-end development project. As a beginner, I spent lots of time learning HTML5 and CSS to make the site responsive; I also used JavaScript to program the image picker, allowing users to view different images using tabs in web and dropdown in mobile. <br><br>
      By doing actual front-end development myself, I got a deeper empathy with developers. I got to know some buzzwords like box-model and specificity, understand how positioning works in CSS, etc. In this way, I was able to design with both user needs and a developer mind.</p>
      <figure class="gap">
        <img src="../img/2-15.1.gif" alt="animation of Instant feature">
        <figcaption>2-15.1 / In the above example, I was only responsible for the UI development and limited functionality such as file picker and the small pop up window. All other functions such as browser compatibility and end-points to the portal were handled by other developers.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h2 id="challenge">Two Challenges</h2>
      <p>Besides the design problem, there were two other major challenges in the design journey: <b>the nanopay rebranding and the change of technology framework</b>.<br><br>
      The fresh and new nanopay branding required me to reinvent the visual experience of B2B platform.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/2-16.png" srcset="../img/2-16@2x.png 2x, ../img/2-16@3x.png 3x" alt="the rebranding of nanopay">
        <figcaption>2-16 / Along with the rebrand, we have a redefined color palette so I rip out the old style and reinvented the look and feel of the B2B portal</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In the middle of the project, the development team decided to switch the framework to <span><a href="https://foam-framework.github.io/foam/" target="_blank">FOAM, an open-source modeling framework developed at Google,</a></span> and hook all the nanopay services to one platform with access control for different clients to access to different services instead of building different portals, to achieve higher performance. <br><br>
      The change of the technology direction challenged me on the <b>scalability and compatibility</b> of my design, as all the services will share the same design structure, similar user flow and experience, with the same look and feel. However, this is also an excellent opportunity, which led to my latest project - <span><a href="system.html"> nanopay Design System: Accelerating Design and Development</a></span>.</p>
      
      <h2 id="launch">Launch</h2>
      <p>In Dec 2017, <span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2017/nanopay-b2b-payments-platform/" target="_blank">nanopay launched B2B portal in a private beta-testing with invited partners</a></span>. We've started to gain more insights once users began to onboard, and are working continuously on improving the user experience.</p>
